Task-Managemnt 


This is Next.js for frontend and Node.js for backend in this  Project
I have created this project by 

npx create-next-app@latest

## Getting Started

First, run the development server: for backend 

npx nodemon/npm start both will work 

backend server will start at localhost:5000


Start Server for Frontend 
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

* I have MongoDB data base 

I have created backend folder and run these all command 

npm init -y 

npm install express mongoose cors dotenv

I have Installed nodemon for starting backend server therefore you can start server from this command 
npx nodemon
